                    <p>The National Hockey League is a professional ice hockey league that started at the Windsor Hotel on November 26, 1917.
                        Since it's inception, it's headquarters were the city of Montreal, but as of 1989, it is now Manhattan.</p> 
                    <p>Hockey games are played as seasons every single year, and each year the coveted trophy, the Stanley Cup,
                        is awarded to the winner.</p>
                    <p>There are a total of 32 different teams of which some have been a part of the league since it's debut.
                        These are the Montreal Canadiens, and the Ottawa Senators. 
                        All the other teams were added afterwards, or no longer exist</p>

                    <h3><span class ="titles"> Rules </span></h3>
                    <p>Ice hockey is a high contact sport that can be very violent and aggressive at times.</p>
                    <p>Two opposing teams try to score points on each others nets by putting a rubber disc known as a puck 
                        into each other's nets with a hockey stick while actively avoiding the opposing team. </p>
                    <p>Hockey games are played on a ice hockey rink as shown on the bottom </p>
                    <p>If players do not follow the rules, they are given "time-outs" and are benched for a specific amount of
                        time depending on the infraction they committed.</p>
